# 1 Document Upload

Lenders will upload the relevant documents to an s3 bucket. The uploads can be found when logging in to aws-console
under s3/uploads-all-arboreum/<process.ENVIRONMENT>/user_uploads/lenderKYC/<lender-email-address>
and a download-link to the documents is posted to the slack-integrations-channel.

the user then sees a screen that tells them that their application is being reviewed.
