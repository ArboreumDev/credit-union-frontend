We have received your request to borrow {{loan_amount}} via the {{company}} Credit Program.

We are currently reaching out to your supporters to ask for their approval.

If your application receives sufficient support, we will shortly be in contact with a loan proposal, which you can then accept or reject.

If your application does not receive sufficient support, we will be in contact to propose that you either adjust your maximum loan request amount, or pick from a range of alternative loan terms.
