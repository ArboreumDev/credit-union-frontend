Hi {{name}},

Recently, you took out a loan of {{loan_amount}} through the {{company}} Credit Program.

We were unable to process your most recent repayment of {{loan_repayments}}, which was due on the {{loan_repaydate}}.

If you have not already informed HR of this missed payment, please do so as soon as possible to avoid funds being garnished from your salary.

Best wishes,

Arboreum, on behalf of {{company}}
